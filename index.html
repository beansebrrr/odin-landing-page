      Glasses are really versatile. First, you can have glasses-wearing girls
      take them off and suddenly become beautiful, or have girls wearing glasses
      flashing those cute grins, or have girls stealing the protagonist's
      glasses and putting them on like, "Haha, got your glasses!" That's just
      way too cute! Also, boys with glasses! I really like when their glasses
      have that suspicious looking gleam, and it's amazing how it can look
      really cool or just be a joke. I really like how it can fulfill all those
      abstract needs. Being able to switch up the styles and colors of glasses
      based on your mood is a lot of fun too! It's actually so much fun! You
      have those half rim glasses, or the thick frame glasses, everything! It's
      like you're enjoying all these kinds of glasses at a buffet. I really want
      Luna to try some on or Marine to try some on to replace her eyepatch. We
      really need glasses to become a thing in hololive and start selling them
      for HoloComi. Don't. You. Think. We. Really. Need. To. Officially. Give.
      Everyone. Glasses?
